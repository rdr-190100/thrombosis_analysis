Collagen diseases are autoimmune diseases in which the immune system of the body attacks its own skin, tissues, and organs. For example, if a patient generates antibodies for lung, they will lose their ability to do respiration and will die. The extent and causes of these diseases are partially known and not well understood and hence their classification can be a challenging task.<br>\nOne of these diseases is `Thrombosis`, which is an important and severe complication and is also one of the major causes of death in collagen diseases. It was recently discovered by medical physicians that Thrombosis is closely related to anti-cardiolipin antibodies. The Databases used in this project are donated by one of these physicians from a University Hospital where patients came regarding collagen diseases and were recommended by their local physicians, home doctors, and other medical specialists.\n\n# Initial Questions\n\n1. Is it possible for some age bands to be more likely to get diagnosed with higher degrees of Thrombosis than others?\n2. Are females more likely to get diagnosed with Thrombosis or is it vice-versa?\n3. How can other medical tests be incorporated to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis?\n\n# Data Munging\n\n## Import Libraries\n\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nimport datetime\nimport snakecase\nimport re\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\npd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\", None)\n```\n\n## Import Data\n\n```{python}\na = pd.read_csv(\"data/TSUMOTO_A.CSV\")\nb = pd.read_csv(\"data/TSUMOTO_B.CSV\")\nc = pd.read_csv(\"data/TSUMOTO_C.CSV\")\n```\n\n### Data Sample\n\n**Tsumoto_A - Basic Information about Patients (Input by Experts).

All the datasets had ID of the patient which was the joining parameter used to perform analytical joins. `These datasets roughly covered the demographic aspect of each patient, the medical test history of each patient and the factors for thrombosis diagnosis of some patients`. There were tons of missing data in all these datasets since there are patients who opt-out of providing their personal information and/or have done only a few medical tests per visit. `These missing values were carefully imputed` after going through entire datasets and also with the help of some domain knowledge. Along with the imputation, the columns and rows which had more than 70% missing values were dropped from the data to avoid assumption of wrong values to impute. Some `feature extraction` was performed such as calculating the Age of the Patient at the time when Thrombosis tests were performed which would be later useful for analysis.<br>After getting the final dataframe, `Exploratory Data Analysis (Preliminary and Visual)` was performed to help understand the data better and answer the initial questions. Most of the Patients who tested for Thrombosis were between ages 19 to 45 and only a few patients who were more than 61 years of age tested for Thrombosis. Further, the distribution of Positive and Negative Thrombosis patients after testing had a huge difference (only 16% of the patients tested were diagnosed as positive). If further statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms are to be applied to predict the Thrombosis results, more data for Positive thrombosis patients need to be introduced since the dataset is imbalanced currently. Patients from the age of 19 to 45 have the highest probability of getting diagnosed with Mild Thrombosis. This pattern changes for Severe Thrombosis where patients who are not adults yet (0-18 years) are most likely to get diagnosed with Severe Thrombosis. Females are more likely to test positive for Thrombosis as compared to Males but these reports are from just one hospital and this observation cannot be generalized for the entire world.<br>Apart from Thrombosis specific tests such as acl_igG (Anticardiolipin Antibody IgG) and ANA (Antinuclear Antibody), common medical tests such as U-Pro (Proteinuria), GPT (ALT glutamic pylvic transaminase), GOT (AST glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase), C3 and C4 (Complement 3 and 4), RBC (Red Blood Cells), HCT (Hematoclit), PLT (Platelet) and HGB (Hemoglobin) were found to be correlated to the Thrombosis Diagnosis. Since, correlation coefficients cannot be the only measure to see if these tests are relevant while diagnosis Thrombosis, further Visual analysis was performed if there are any significant patterns in these tests to look out for while diagnosing Thrombosis.<br>Tests like C3 and C4 had significant patterns while tests like HGB, HCT and Platelet count did not show any significant patterns while diagnosing Thrombosis. Some tests like U-PRO, GOT and GPT had few patterns that might be good to look at while diagnosing extreme severe cases of Thrombosis. Overall the data required a lot of assumptions while imputing the missing values and the analysis performed was only preliminary. `These analysis can be further broken down to the granular level to understand the factors affecting Thrombosis Diagnosis by performing Machine Learning algorithms to predict the Thrombosis Diagnosis.`\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"self-contained":true,"embed-resources":true,"toc-depth":6,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"lumen","page-layout":"full","title":"EDA on Medical Data of Thrombosis Diagnosis","title-location":"center","jupyter":"python3","toc-location":"right"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
